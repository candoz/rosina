# Robotic Swarm in ARGoS

## About the project

This is the final project for the [Intelligent Robotic Systems course](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2018/384267) by professor [Andrea Roli](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/andrea.roli).  

Our goal is to reproduce part of the work done by Shervin Nouyan, Alexandre Campo and Marco Dorigo regarding **robotic chain formations** with the aim of deepening the subject, reworking the controller logic and finally simulate it in an ARGoS environment. Link to the article: [Path formation in a robot swarm](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11721-007-0009-6).

## Considerations and results

TODO: Link to the report and eventually some brief consideration

## About the simulator

ARGoS — http://www.argos-sim.info
* Written in C++, open source
* Multi-robot simulator
* Multi-threaded
* Multiple sub-spaces, each with a different physical engine
* It allows cross-compilation
* Controllers programmable also in Lua

You may find more information on programming robots in Lua with ARGoS at: http://www.argos-sim.info/plow2015/
